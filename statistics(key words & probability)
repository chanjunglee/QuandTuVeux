# "통계학개론"'s summary 

# 1. data and statics

# statics 통계
  a study of collecting relevant data on the target's object and summarizing and arranging the data 
  to find out conclusions or general rules of uncertainty.

- two types in statics
1. descriptive statics 기술통계
   the way of getting entirely attributes by summarizing with tables, graphs, numeric values that represented data 

2. inferential statics 추측통계
   the way of inferenting and generizing the analized data from randomly samples of total

# key words

population (*pop)모집단
 - all target that for analysis 
  - type : infinite pop  / finite pop

sample 표본
 - some of population
   the reason samples are selected randomly(in random sampling) from total 
   sometimes how much do these samples represent to populations can be an important matter. 
   cuz this is related with whether we accept the analized results or not.

parameter 모수
 - numerical characteristic value of population
 
 statistic 통계량
  - numerical characteristic value of sample. 
    ex) 175cm(<-statistics) is the meaning of korean's height on 100 guys
 
unit 단위
 - item of object to be obseved
   ex) person A : each person that observed 
   
observation 관찰값
 - information or characteristics are written from each observation's unit.
   ex) person A's weight
   
data 데이터
  - combining of observations
  ex) the korean(people: this is for a specific purpose) consisted of each person(unit)
  
variable 변수
  - characteristics measured for each unit
  - type : 1. qualitative variable  
              a. nominal , b. ordinal 
           2. quantitative variable 
              a. discrete , b. countinous
    ex) person of "gender"(M/F) or "marriage"(S/M) or "height"(173cm,182cm...)
              
# frequency (distribution) table 도수분포표
  a table that arranged to count each class frequency of data's values or data belongs in each divided sections of the total
  
# graph and plot 그래프
  - qaulititive data 1. pie chart 2. bold bar graph
  - quantatitive data 2. histogram 2. stem-and-leaf plot 3. dot plot(* outlier) 4. time series plot(*trend *seasonal variation)
  
 
#  2. summary of data
 - mean 평균 / median 중앙값 / mode 최빈값 
 @ which case should we use a "mean" or "median"? what if the "mode"?
 
 - measure of variability(measure of spread) 변동의 측도(산포의 측도) / range 범위 / 
   interquartile range(IQR) 사분위수범위 / percentile 백분위수 / five-number-summary 다섯 수치요약 / skewness 비대칭도(왜도)
   * skewness
     the degree of asymmetry about a distribution of random variables(real number).
 @ above conceptions are related with the "distribution" (of values). 
 @ like how distribution of data looks like, how many observations are located in a specific section.
  
 what i want to mention shortly here is the way to get the outlier(이상치). 
 
 step = 1.5*IQR
 x : observation
 if x < Q1 - (1.5*IQR) or x > Q3 + (1.5*IQR) 
 then, x is defined to "outlier".
 
 # variance(*var) 분산 and standard deviation(*sd) 표준편차
 
- variance(*var) = a square of sd 분산
 standard deviation(*sd) = an average of gaps between average and all observations.  
 
 cf. the point is when we get the sd, you should divide (n-1) instead of n.
     it's said that when it's divided to n-1 is much more representative to pop's sd than it's applied to n(a size of sample)
 
 coefficient of variance 변동계수(변이계수)
 sometimes when comparing vars(or sds) of two data or more than that, if one data has different units of measurement with another data
 you need to adjust to each other. the coefficient of variance is that.
 
 (pop) C = (var / mean) * 100(%) 
 (sample) C = (sd / mean) * 100(%)

  # random variable 확률변수
   function to match one real value to each element of sample space
   
   when the values of random variable are countable, discrete random variable. 이산형 확률 변수
    - probability distribution function 확률 분포 함수 
    - cumulative distribution function 누적 확률 분포 함수
   when the values of random variable are uncountable, continuous random variable. 연속형 확률 변수
    in this case, infinite values can be possible the values. so it's meaningless to calculate a point, but 
    mostly the values for a specific interval have a meaning. sometimes, we gatta use the integral or the uniform distribution 
    when cases that the interval values are too ambiguous to get the results.    
   @ uniform distribution 균등함수     
  
  # expected value of random variable 기대값
    - discrete E(g(X)) = ∑g(xi)f(xi)
    - continous E(g(X)) = ∫ g(x)f(x)dx (∫ -∞ to ∞)
  
  # the variance of random variable X 확률변수 X의 분산
   var(X) = E((X-μ)**2)     
   
  # the variance of X X의 분산
   Var(X) = E[(X-μ)**2] = E(X**2)-μ**2
   
    - E(X) = expected value, var(X) = variace, 
      E(aX+b) = aE(X) +b
      var(aX+b) = a**2var(X)
  
  # the standardized random variable 표준화된 확률변수
    - μ = mean, σ=√var(X)=sd, if it's gonna standardized

4. probability distribution and sample distribution
    
    - discrete probability distribution

      2. hypergeometric distribution 초기하분포
      3. poisson distribution 포아송분포
    
    - continuous probability distribution
      1. normal distribution 정규분포
     
   # binomal distribution 이항분포
    * bernoulli trial 베르누이 시행
      the expetiment that has a result just two, true(1) or false(0) under the same success probability. 
      if p is defined a success probability in this trial, 
      then, the distribution of bernoulli random variable X is as follows
      
      P(X=x)=p**x(1-p)**(1-x), x=0,1
      
      like this, when it's repeated a bernoulli trial independently, the distribution of X(=count of success) 
      is called the binomial distribution and it's marked B(n,p)
              
      P(X=x)=(nCx)p**x(1-p)**n-x, x=0,1,2,3..n (nCr : at C is combination)
      mean : E(X)=np , var : Var(x)=np(1-p) , n : number of trials , p : probability of success
      
   # hypergeometric distribution 초기하분포
      in bernoulli experiment(1,0), attributes N = size of population , D = number of 1 in pop(N-D : 0), 
      n = size of sample, x = 1's number in sample,
    
      P(X=x)=DCx * (N-D)C(n-x) / NCn , x=0,1,2,3..n (DCx ,(N-D)C(n-x) , NCn : at C is combination)
    
    *** only, n < N , x < D (you have to caution this condition that x < D, that is "x < D" means "n-x < N-D", "n < N and n < N-D"). 
    
      mean : E(X) = np (only, p=D/N) , var : var(X) = np(1-p)*((N-n) / (N-1))
      @ the var of hypergeometric distribution is multipled by finite population correction factor(유한모집단 수정계수 : ((N-n) / (N-1))). 
      @ so if the N is bigger, this factor is much closer to 1.
      
   # Poisson distribution 포아송분포
      generally, this is used as you want to get a rarely, very small probability 
      like the probability of seoul city's blackout in a day.
      and it also has to be satisfied three conditions for applying :
      
      1. independency 독립성
        한 단위시간이나 공간에서 출현하는 성공횟수와 중복되지 않는 다른 단위시간이나 공간에서 출현하는 성공횟수는 서로 독립이다
        the number of successes that occur in one unit time or space and the number of successes 
        that occur in another unit time or space that do not overlap are independent of each other.

      2. non- colony 비집락성
        극히 작은 시간이나 공간에서 둘 또는 그 이상의 성공이 같이 일어날 확률은 매우 작으며 0으로 간주된다
        the probability of two or more successes occurring in very small amounts of time or space is very small 
        and is considered 0

      3. proportional 비례성
        단위시간이나 공간에서 성공의 평균출현횟수는 일정하며, 이는 시간이나 공간에 따라 변하지 않는다
        the average number of occurrences of success in unit time or space is constant, which does not change with time or space.
        
    those three conditions are met, the average number of occurrences of success = m ,
    then the X of probability distribution is 
    
      P(X=x)=e**-m * m**x / x! , x=0,1,2...
         
      mean  = m , var = m
    
    # normal distribution (*ND) 정규분포
      mostly, the continuous probability data that observed around us are distributed near to mean(avg),
      the farther away from the mean, data diminish and the distribution is symmetrical in relation to the average.
      it draws a bell shape(distribution). it's called the normal distribution function or the Gaussian distribution function
      
      f(x) = 1 / √2πσ *exp[-((x-μ)**2 / 2*(σ**2))], -∞ < x < ∞  (μ : mean , σ : sd)
      
      if random variable X follows the upper normal distribution, it marks X~N(μ, σ**2). the characteristics of this are as follows:
      
      1. it's the continuous function of the bell shape
      2. it's symmetrical in relation to the average. 
      3. there are infinitely possible values as per μ or σ.
      4. normal random variables have most of the values around the mean, 
         and fewer than three times the sd from the mean to the left
         (it most commonly used a distribution function, 
         when X is the ND variable in N(μ, σ**2), the probability of the section [a,b](P(a <= X <= b)) is f(x) 's total area 
         surrounding within the x-axis, a, b.
         
         P( a <= X <= b ) = ∫ 1 / √2πσ *exp[-((x-μ)**2 / 2*(σ**2))]*dx (∫ a to b) 
         
         but it's so much harder work to get this area. fortunately, if using the standard normal distribution (*STD),
         that is if    X = N(μ, σ**2) convert to Z(=STD variable) = (X-μ) / σ         <- it's called the standardization
         then Z follows a normal distribution with an average of 0 and a sd of 1 , mean =0 , sd = 1 ( N(0,1) ) 
         
         X is N(μ, σ**2),
            Z = (X-μ) / σ (the standardization)
            
         and probability is like this.
            
            P(a < X < b) = P( (a-μ) / σ < Z < (b-μ) / σ )
            
      # sampling distribution
