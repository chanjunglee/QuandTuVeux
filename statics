# 1. data and statics

# statics
A study of collecting relevant data on the target's object and summarizing and arranging the data 
to find out conclusions or general rules of uncertainty.

- two types in statics
1. descriptive statics : the way of getting entirely attributes by summarizing with tables, graphs, numeric values that represented data.  
2. inferential statics : the way of inferenting and generizing the analized data from randomly samples of total.  

# key words

population 
  meaning : all target that for analysis 
  - type : infinite pop  / finite pop

sample
  - some of population
  the reason samples are selected randomly(in random sampling) from total sometimes how much do these samples represent to populations can be an important matter. 
  cuz this is related with whether we accept the analized results or not.
