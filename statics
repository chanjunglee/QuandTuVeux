# 1. data and statics

# statics
A study of collecting relevant data on the target's object and summarizing and arranging the data 
to find out conclusions or general rules of uncertainty.

- two types in statics
1. descriptive statics : the way of getting entirely attributes by summarizing with tables, graphs, numeric values that represented data.  
2. inferential statics : the way of inferenting and generizing the analized data from randomly samples of total.  

# key words

population 
 - all target that for analysis 
  - type : infinite pop  / finite pop

sample
 - some of population
  the reason samples are selected randomly(in random sampling) from total 
  sometimes how much do these samples represent to populations can be an important matter. 
  cuz this is related with whether we accept the analized results or not.

parameter
 - numerical characteristic value of population
 
 statistic
  - numerical characteristic value of sample
 
unit
 - item of object to be obseved
 
observation
 - information or characteristics are written from each observation's unit.
 
  
data
  - combining of observations
 
variable
  - characteristics measured for each unit
  - type : 1. qualitative variable  
              a. nominal , b. ordinal 
           2. quantitative variable 
              a. discrete , b. countinous
              
# frequency (distribution) table
  a table that arranged to count each class frequency of data's values or data belongs in each divided sections of the total
  
# graph and plot
  - qaulititive data 1. pie chart 2. bold bar graph
  - quantatitive data 2. histogram 2. stem-and-leaf plot 3. dot plot(* outlier) 4. time series plot(*trend *seasonal variation)
  
 

 
# summary of data
 - mean / median / mode 
 - measure of variability(measure of spread) / range / interquartile range(IQR) / percentile / five-number-summary / skewness 
 (what I want to mention shortly here is the way to get outlier. 1.5*IQR )
