# stocks programming with python
# i use CreonPlus on its API with pyhton
# so i'm gonna treat like those, just within first chapter: 

1. to represent some libraries that needed to the developement
2. to confirm that connection
3. to load specific stocks from names, prices, volumes etc. moreover according to several conditions you make

the code provided by Daishin Securities is as follows.
1. win32com library is that help you some programs are able to control as an 'object' in your space 
  so you can connect and control programs on your OS in python. 
  for example, if you code "import win32com.client" at python, you can treat creon-hts in your python ground.
  in this case, in python com object is created.
  

2. import win32com.client
 
 
  # 연결 여부 체크
  objCpCybos = win32com.client.Dispatch("CpUtil.CpCybos")
  # 
  bConnect = objCpCybos.IsConnect
  # CreonPlus 
  if (bConnect == 0):
    print("PLUS가 정상적으로 연결되지 않음. ")
    exit() # exit() 실행되고 있는 코드를 종료시키는 함수
